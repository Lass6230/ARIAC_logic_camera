Introduction to ARIAC Tutorials
=========================================================

This section contains multiple tutorials on how to achieve basic tasks in ARIAC using Python. Some competitors may find these tutorials useful as a starting point for their own code.
Some of these tutorials use both Python and C++ code. The Python code provides the interface to the ROS and ARIAC systems, while the C++ code provides the interface for robot controls with and without Moveit.

The code for tutorials can be found in a Github repository which is separated from the official NIST ARIAC repository. 
The Github repository can be found here: `ariac_tutorials <https://github.com/jaybrecht/ariac_tutorials>`_
The code for each tutorial is located in a separate branch of the repository. The branch name is the same as the tutorial name.

A brief description of each tutorial is provided below.

- `Tutorial 1: <https://github.com/jaybrecht/ariac_tutorials/tree/tutorial_1>`_ : This tutorial shows how to start the competition based on the state of the competition.
- `Tutorial 2: <https://github.com/jaybrecht/ariac_tutorials/tree/tutorial_2>`_ : This tutorial shows how to add a sensor to the sensor configuration file. The sensor is then used to keep track of the number of parts that are spawned on the conveyor belt.
