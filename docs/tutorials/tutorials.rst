Introduction to ARIAC Tutorials
=========================================================

This section contains multiple tutorials on how to achieve basic tasks in ARIAC using Python. Some competitors may find these tutorials useful as a starting point for their own code.
Some of these tutorials use both Python and C++ code. The Python code provides the interface to the ROS and ARIAC systems, while the C++ code provides the interface for robot controls with and without Moveit.

The code for tutorials can be found in a Github repository which is separated from the official NIST ARIAC repository. 
The Github repository can be found here: `ariac_tutorials <https://github.com/jaybrecht/ariac_tutorials>`_
The code for each tutorial is located in a separate branch of the repository. The branch name is the same as the tutorial name.

A brief description of each tutorial is provided below.

- `Tutorial 1: <https://github.com/jaybrecht/ariac_tutorials/tree/tutorial_1>`_ : This tutorial shows how to use the Python interface to the ARIAC system to get information about the competition state and the current state of the robot. It also shows how to use the Python interface to the ROS system to get information about the state of the robot and the environment. This tutorial uses C++ code to control the robot without Moveit.
